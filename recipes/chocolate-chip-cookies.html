        <h4>Chocolate chip cookies</h4>
        <p>Chocolate chip cookies are classic, chewy, and delicious treats made with a simple dough.
             The basic recipe includes butter, sugar (both brown and white), eggs, vanilla extract, flour, baking soda, and salt.
              Chocolate chips are mixed in before baking.
             The dough is scooped onto a baking sheet and baked at around 350°F (175°C) for 10-12 minutes until golden brown.
              Let them cool before enjoying!</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Butter:</strong><p>This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars.
                     The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Eggs:</strong><p> Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong><p>Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Baking soda:</strong><p>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong><p> A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Salt:</strong><p> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Flour:</strong><p> All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Chocolate chips:</strong><p>Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Nuts (optional):</strong><p>Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.</p></li>
            </ul>
